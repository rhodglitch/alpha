      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to let the people know about my white
        water rafting company. Help rafters navigate to the sections that will
        best help them, and make them excited for their tour. The navigators who
        are looking for recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable
        raft to navigate a river or other body of water. Teamwork is often a
        part of the experience. While on vacation they will enjoy to the
        fullest. Die-hard water rafters will be challenged in their stay. They
        will be dealing with risk, but my website would teach them to be safe
        always.
      </p>

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
      <p>
        I chose the Lato+QingKe+HuangYou; The reason I chose this font because I
        think it's still profession and at the same time it's fun! It is
        important to be consitent with a website, so that's why I'm choosing the
        one font.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Heading Font: Lobster;
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The reason I chose this font as the heading is because it's a little
        bold, curly, flashy and fun, which will grab the audience attention.
        First impression last, the heading must be catchy to all who see the
        heading.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lato+QingKe+HuangYou;

      <p>
        The reason I chose this font because It is easy to read, professional,
        and it's fun!

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        Are you looking for a White Water Rafting where there's coral white
        sandbar, crystal clear water, and rich diving site?

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
